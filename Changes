0.00012 - May 28 2015
    - Fixed an integer underflow by completely redoing the binary
      search -- this code was stolen from whatever ketama code
      I stole the algorithm from, and so it used to exist for the
      longest time... and so, in order to not break already hashed
      data that probably exists in the wild, the old binary search
      is left in tact.
      You can change the search mechanism by passing "use_hashfunc"
      parameter to the constructor

0.00011 - Feb 18 2015
    - The library now properly handles hashing binary data. Previously
      it would expect NULL-terminated strings.

    - Fixed a bug with the code segfaulting on some keys, e.g. the
      pack "H*" versions of 161c6d14dae73a874ac0aa0017fb8340 and
      37292b669dd8f7c952cf79ca0dc6c5d7

      This was discovered "in the wild" in a system that deals with
      billions of keys, htese keys just so happened to trigger a
      segfault in the library due to how the binary search works.

0.00010 - Mar 1 2013
    - No code change. Just a re-release of 0.00009

0.00009 - Oct 20 2012
    - No code change
    - Upgrade to Module::Install 1.06
      (see http://weblog.bulknews.net/post/33907905561/do-not-ship-modules-with-module-install-1-04)

0.00008 - May 15 2012
    * Add hash_with_hashnum(), label_from_hashnum(). This allows clients to
      cache the hashed values -- thus avoiding the need to recompute the
      MD5 hash. However, you should make sure you know what you're doing
      before using these (Steffen Mueller)
